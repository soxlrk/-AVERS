      <p>We wanted to create a platform for students to familiarize themselves with personal finance. Today, financial skills are not taught in most schools. Many young adults never learn how to budget their money, stay out of debt, and pay their bills. If you are not born with parents who have good financial skills, then learning to be fiscally responsible may come as a harder task. $AVERS is here to provide information on the financial skills necessary for success.</p><br>
    </div>
    <div class="w3-panel w3-green">
      <p>In the future we hope to create an interactive app where students can put their skills to the test. Users will be able to set a goal amount of money that they wish to save with deadline to reach that amount. Users will also be able to track their spending and savings. We keep in mind that most students do not have steady salaries, nor do most have proper bank account or pay taxes. This will be an app made by students for students with their needs in mind.</p>

      <h4>Why do we have taxes?</h4>
      <p class="w3-text-white">When you pay taxes, that money goes towards paying for certain aspects of the government. Your federal taxes (the taxes you pay to the country itself) go towards funding things like the military, Medicare, and Social Security. Your state taxes (taxes you pay to the state you live in) go to education, transportation, health care, and correctional facilities. Not all states have a state tax.</p><br>

      <h4>What is income tax?</h4>
      <p class="w3-text-white">Income tax is a tax levied on overall income. All people who earn a salary must pay a federal income tax. Some states require you to pay a state income tax. States such as Alaska, Florida, Nevada, South Dakota, Texas, Washington, and Wyoming do not require you to pay a state income tax.</p><br>

      <h4>Work Permits:</h4>
      <p class-"w3-text-white">If you are under the age of 18, you may need to show a work permit, if necessary in your state. The Federal Government does not require a work permit/working papers for teenagers under 18 to be employed. However, states have different rules that govern age requirements, types of employment, and the hours teens can work. Many states require 15, 16, and 17 year olds to get working papers authorized by their high school. To look up a department of labor for a specific state go to: <a href= "https://www.dol.gov/whd/contacts/state_of.htm" target="_blank">https://www.dol.gov/whd/contacts/state_of.htm</a></p><br>
      <h4>What is a W4 Form?</h4>
      <p class="w3-text-white">The IRS (the Internal Revenue Service is the agency that collects federal taxes) requires employers to report each employees salary information. Form W-4 will indicate how much money, if any, the government will have your employer withhold from your paychecks. There are other forms of taxes withheld as well, but the federal tax is the greatest amount. In addition to federal income tax, there is state and local income tax, as well as social security and Medicaid tax
      called FICA. Your FICA payments go into a pool that helps to pay for retirement and illness for those currently needing it. Theoretically, when you are old or sick and ready to retire or unable to work, you can draw from this pool. Depending on the hours you work and the salary you recieve, you will be able to accumuate more social security.</p><br>
      <h4>Am I exempt from paying taxes?</h4>
      <p class="w3-text-white">You may be exempt from withholding taxes if you are paid less than $1,500 annually. Be sure to check the current tax law. If you are exempt then you can fill out the general info on the W-4 (lines 1,2,3 and 4) and then on line 7 write the word EXEMPT. If you are unsure how much you will earn in the year you should not call yourself exempt. You can have taxes withheld and then receive a refund after filing your tax forms in April. </p>

<!-- This is the credit section-->
    <div id="Credit" class="w3-container menu w3-padding-48 w3-card w3-green">
      <h4>What is Credit?</h4>
      <p class="w3-text-white">“The provision of money, goods, or services with the expectation of future payment.”- Merriam Webster Dictionary</p><br>

      <h4>What is a Credit Score?</h4>
      <p class="w3-text-white">It is a three digit score that banks use to determine how likely you are to pay off a loan or if they should approve you for a credit card. Your credit score ranges from 300-850. The higher your credit score, the more likely banks are to approve you for a credit card or a loan. </p><br>

      <h4>What determines my Credit Score?</h4>
      <p class="w3-text-white">Your credit score can be determined by your payment history (if you pay your credit card bills or loan payments on time vs. late), how long you’ve had credit, how much debt you have, and other factors. </p><br>

      <h4>Credit Cards vs. Debit Cards</h4>
      <p class="w3-text-white">When you charge an item to a debit card, the money comes directly out of your checking account. When you charge an item to a credit card, the purchase is charged to a line of credit that is billed to you later. The only difference is where the money is being directly withdrawn from.</p><br>
<!-- This is the budget section -->
    </div>
    <div id="Budget" class="w3-container menu w3-padding-48 w3-card w3-green">
      <h4>What is budgeting?</h4>
      <p class="w3-text-white">Budgeting is the process of creating a plan for how to spend and save your money.</p><br>

      <h4>Why is it important to have a budget?</h4>
      <p class="w3-text-white">If you budget, you can ensure that you will always have enough money for the necessities and important things that you want. Following a budget can also keep you out of debt or help you stay on track to repay your debt. Budgeting could help you save for an expensive vacation or a new laptop.</p><br>

      <h4>How to budget?</h4>
      <ol class= w3-text-white>
        <li>You should figure out how much money you have coming in. See what your monthly income is. If you don’t have a monthly income, then make note of how much money you have. </li>
        <li>You should categorize and track your spending. Think what items are necessary and which ones are not. It might be a good idea to make a spreadsheet tracking the money you have and the money you spend.</li>
        <li>Think about what you can cut out. Cutting out a $2.50 morning cup of coffee can save you a lot of money.</li>
        <li>Make a goal. Think about an item you really want or an amount of money you would like to save up. Set a date you would like to reach this goal by. </li>
        <li>Stick to the budget!</li>
        <li>Keep in mind that not every method of budgeting works for everybody. Try out different methods until you find one that works for you.</li>
      </ol>

<!-- This is the Investing Section -->
  </div>
  <div id="Investing" class="w3-container menu w3-padding-48 w3-card w3-green">
    <h4>What is investing?</h4>
    <p class="w3-text-white">Famous investor, Warren Buffett, defines investing as “the process of laying out money now in the expectation of receiving more money in the future.” In other words, it means putting your money into something that will hopefully yield you more money later on. </p><br>

    <h4>Why is investing important?</h4>
    <p class="w3-text-white">No matter what you’re investing in, the goal is to use your money to make more of it. In the future, the money you make from investing can be extremely rewarding, especially when you increase your wealth. Investing will not only make your money grow but will also help you achieve financial security. Whether it be future goals you have set or unexpected events that turn your life around, investing is there to assist you and make the process easier.</p><br>

    <h4>What can you invest in?</h4>
    <p class="w3-text-white">There are many things people can invest in, ranging from small to big ideas. You can invest in  stocks, a personal business, and mutual funds (where you can pool together your money with other investors).</p><br>
    <p class="w3-text-white">Another important investment is a 401k, which is a retirement plan that allows workers to take out money from their paychecks before taxes and invest it for the future. A 401 k helps you save money for when you retire. It is up to you to decide how much you want to be deducted from each paycheck and put into the plan. It’s important to understand that a 401k is not a savings account that you can access anytime. It is a retirement plan that allows you to save up for when you are finished working. If you take money out of your 401K before the proper age of retirement, you will be heavily taxed on the money you withdraw.</p><br>

    <h4>How to get started in investing?</h4>
    <p class="w3-text-white">To begin investing, you need to open a brokerage account. This will be the account where your investments are held. Once the account is opened, you can start putting in funds that you will use to buy investments. </p><br>

    <h4>How to be a smart investor?</h4>
    <p class="w3-text-white">If you’re new to investing, it is important you understand where you are placing your money. For example, if an investment offers a higher return, there is a greater risk at losing your money. Make sure you are investing in both high and low-risk investments to ensure that your money is spread out. It is also a good idea to invest in different areas, allowing you to spread your assets over a wide range. Lastly, do your research. The more you become familiar with the different types of investments the easier it will become. Investing can be very beneficial, as long as you put in the effort. </p>
  </div>
<!-- This is the Banking section -->
  <div id="Banking" class="w3-container menu w3-padding-48 w3-card w3-green">
    <h4>What is a Bank?</h4>
    <p class="w3-text-white">A bank is a financial institution involved in borrowing and lending money. When you deposit your money into a bank, the bank pays you an annual interest on the amount of money you deposited. The bank will then take the money you deposited and use it to loan to other people. </p><br>

    <h4>What is a bank account and Why Should I have one?</h4>
    <p class="w3-text-white">A bank account is a financial account managed by the bank you choose to deposit your money into. You should have a bank account because it makes managing your money much easier. You can go to the bank or go online anytime and view your accounts. It also provides a safe place for your money. Storing large amounts of cash in one place is not very safe. Keeping you money in a bank gives it a low risk of getting stolen.
</p><br>
    <h4>Types of Bank Accounts</h4>
    <li class="w3-text-white">Checking Accounts</li>
      <ul>
        <li class ="w3-text-white">Checking accounts are used for the money you spend. These are often the types of accounts that people use to pay bills.</li>
        <li class = "w3-text-white">Banks offer different types of checking accounts. These accounts have different requirements. Some accounts require for you to keep a minimum amount in the account or they will charge a monthly fee.</li>
      </ul>
    <li class="w3-text-white">Savings Accounts</li>
      <ul>
        <li class ="w3-text-white">Savings Accounts are for long term saving. If you want to save up for a house, a car, or an expensive vacation, that money would go into a savings account.</li>
      </ul>
    <li class ="w3-text-white">Money Market Accounts</li>
      <ul>
        <li class ="w3-text-white">Money market accounts serve a similar purpose to savings accounts, but they tend to have higher interest rates. These accounts also usually require you to have a higher minimum balance.</li><br>
      </ul>
    <h4>How to Open a Bank Account</h4>
    <p class="w3-text-white">First, you should choose your prefered bank (TD Bank, Citi Bank, Bank of America, etc.). Most banks allow you to set up a bank account online. You can also visit the bank in person and speak with a teller to set up an account.</p><br>
  </div>
  <!--This is the Loans section-->
  <div id="Loans" class="w3-container menu w3-padding-48 w3-card w3-green">
    <h4>What is a loan?</h4>
    <p class="w3-text-white">Loans refer to the lending of money from one party to another, which is typically paid back with interest in the future.</p>
    <!-- This is the light bulb picture -->
    <img src="http://www.pngmart.com/files/7/Light-Bulb-Transparent-PNG-279x279.png" align="left" width="90" height="90" />
    <p class="w3-text-white"> Interest is a charge of payment for the loan, generally a percentage of the amount borrowed. When it comes to loans, it’s better to have low interest rates in order to pay less interest.</p><br>

    <h4>What are the different types of loans?</h4>
    <p class="w3-text-white">Student loans are used to pay for college expenses. There are two main types: federal student loans and private student loans, which usually come from banks. Federal student loans are considered better because they generally have lower interest rates and more flexible repaying times.</p><br>
    <p class="w3-text-white">Other loans out there such as mortgages and auto loans, can help citizens buy homes and afford vehicles. Regardless of the loan, borrowers need to be responsible. It’s important to keep track of all the loan documents and the amount one is borrowing. If one does not understand their loan and does not make payments on time, it can lead to problems such as debt.</p><br>
  </div>

  <!-- This is the debt section -->
  <div id="DEBT" class="w3-container menu w3-padding-48 w3-card w3-green">
    <h4>What is debt?</h4>
    <p class="w3-text-white">Debt is the money a person or organization owes somebody else.</p><br>

    <h4>What are the causes?</h4>
    <p class="w3-text-white">There are different causes of debt, one of the most popular being poor money management. For many people, managing money is extremely difficult and not taught in schools. Often times, people spend more money than they earn, getting themselves into trouble. People also don’t spend their time looking over their expenses, not realizing they are overspending on unnecessary things. It’s one thing to have money and another to understand how it works. Not understanding how to spend your money correctly can play a big role into putting you to debt.
    </p><br>

    <p class="w3-text-white">Other causes of debt include unexpected circumstances such as divorce or sickness. Not only do both events hurt you psychologically, but also financially. It can be difficult to manage your money at sensitive times, especially when numerous sums of money are needed.</p><br>

    <h4>What are the Consequences?</h4>
    <p class="w3-text-white">Unfortunately, having too much debt can lower your credit score, forcing you to pay higher interest rates. It can also make it harder to rent an apartment or buy a car. The consequences of debt also span to hurting people's mental health, putting them under a lot of stress and pressure to meet deadlines.</p><br>

    <h4>Bankruptcy</h4>
    <p class="w3-text-white">People file for bankruptcy when the debt that they have is greater than the value of their combined assets. People file for bankruptcy to get out of debt as a last resort. Filing for bankruptcy can eliminate some of your debt. In some cases people will need to sell some of their assets as a result of filing for bankruptcy.</p><br>
    <img src="http://www.pngmart.com/files/7/Light-Bulb-Transparent-PNG-279x279.png" align="left" width="90" height="90" />
    <p class="w3-text-white">An asset is an economic resource. Assets include but are not limited to cars, houses, art, collectibles, precious metals, intellectual property, and technology.</p><br>

    <h4>How to get out of debt?</h4>
    <p class="w3-text-white">Being in debt is difficult, but there are steps you can take to make the process easier</p>
<ul>
    <li class ="w3-text-white">You need to understand that you’re in debt and have to stop borrowing. Spending more money than you earn is not smart and will only keep you in a vicious cycle of debt.</li>
    <li class = "w3-text-white">The next step is to make a plan. There are different payment plans that can help you reduce your debt. A popular method is the snowball plan, which targets one debt at a time. The idea is that you first pay off the smallest debt to gain momentum in your snowball plan, addressing the largest debt last.</li>
    <li class ="w3-text-white">Learn from your mistakes. Once you’re done or almost done with paying off everything, don’t fall back into old habits. Make a budget and keep track of all your expenses to make sure you’re spending your money efficiently.</li>
